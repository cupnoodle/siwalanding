    <!-- the obscure error message certainly doesn‚Äôt help -->
    <p>
      Apple require us to implement Sign in with Apple <strong>latest by 30th June 2020</strong>. And yet the documentation is severely lacking, what should we do after getting user data from Sign in with Apple on iOS side? What does the error message like invalid_client even mean? You start to worry what if you couldn‚Äôt implement Sign in with Apple before the deadline, and Apple rejected your app upcoming update, causing the delay of some fixes/updates to your app, which makes <strong>your users and your boss unhappy</strong> üò£.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>‚ÄúI have wasted so much time trying to solve the error, the error message isn't even helpful!‚Äù</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      You have followed a tutorial on how to implement Sign in with Apple step by step, but you are stuck at the dreaded ‚Äúinvalid_client‚Äù or "invalid_grant" error every time you try to validate the authorization code with /auth/token.
      <br><br>
      Alright, I know it tells me the client is invalid... <strong>then what should I do to fix this?!</strong>
      <br><br>
      You checked your client_id, client_secret and even the redirect_uri parameters, all of them seem correct, then you try to swap client_id with the app bundle ID, web services ID, changing the headers used to generate the client secret JWT‚Ä¶ hours has passed and despite all the trial and error, you are still getting the same ‚Äúinvalid_client‚Äù error! ü§¨
      <br><br>
      The error message ‚Äúinvalid_client‚Äù isn‚Äôt particularly helpful as <strong>it doesn‚Äôt say which part of your code is wrong</strong>, could it be your client_id? client_secret? or could it be the authorization code that you‚Äôve gotten from the app isn‚Äôt formatted properly? <strong>You wished Apple would provide a more helpful error message on solving the issue</strong>.

    <h2>‚ÄúI have scoured all the documentation at length and have still not gotten anywhere.‚Äù</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    After spending countless hours battling the token validating issue, you have finally managed to retrieve the token! yay! But now you are stuck again, as there isn‚Äôt even a word in Apple documentation on how to handle subsequent REST API call after user has signed in successfully! As the token returned from validating authorization code is just valid for 10 minutes, and Apple only allow <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/verifying_a_user">refreshing token once a day</a> (more than that will result in throttling), how should we handle subsequent REST API call to the backend using token?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    There‚Äôs an endpoint to get Apple public key, but how do I even use this hash to verify signature?! This certainly doesn‚Äôt look like a public key file format (eg: ‚Äî‚ÄìBEGIN PUBLIC KEY‚Äî‚Äì xxxxxx ‚Äî‚ÄìEND PUBLIC KEY‚Äî‚Äì ) :

    <p>Enough complain about Apple, let‚Äôs pause a moment and imagine....</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>What if you could implement Sign in with Apple <span class="green">within a day</span>, submit the app update to App Store confidently and continue on with your feature implementations / bug fixes?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if there‚Äôs a <strong>straightforward, step-by-step guide which you can follow</strong> to implement Sign in with Apple? From generating public key, validate authorization code, validating and parsing identityToken to subsequent REST API calls between your iOS app to your server?</p>

    <br>
    <p>You could implement Sign in with Apple <strong>within a day</strong>, and continue working on <strong>features or bug fixes that matters</strong>, which make your users happier (and also your boss).</p>
    <br>
    <br>

<!--     <h2>Learn the workings of JWT (JSON Web Token) and JWK (JSON Web Key)</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Most of the frustration arise when implementing Sign in with Apple is because we haven‚Äôt deal with JSON Web Token before, and generating a JSON Web Token (JWT) for the <strong>client_secret</strong> can be a confusing step especially Apple is using a quirky algorithm named ‚ÄúRS256‚Äù elliptic curve.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      IdentityToken retrieved from Apple‚Äôs API is also in JWT format, which contains an unique identifier for the user in the <strong>sub</strong> key :

    <p>The book will show the overall flow of Sign in with Apple, and explain each of steps from retrieving authorizationCode from iOS app, to generating client secret, to overview of your own access token generation strategies. All of the backend steps involved with Sign in with Apple comes with sample code in <strong>Ruby, PHP, Python and NodeJS</strong>.

      This book is focused on <strong>practical steps</strong> (using libraries for handling cryptography and decoding, instead of explaining theory and rolling your own), concisely written to <strong>help you finish implement the whole Sign in with Apple flow as quickly as possible</strong>, so you can move on to implement those really important features / fixes.</p>
